    "In supervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training dataset by iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer. While supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning models, they require upfront human intervention to label the data appropriately. For example, a supervised learning model can predict how long your commute will be based on the time of day, weather conditions and so on. But first, you’ll have to train it to know that rainy weather extends the driving time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning models, in contrast, work on their own to discover the inherent structure of unlabeled data. Note that they still require some human intervention for validating output variables. For example, an unsupervised learning model can identify that online shoppers often purchase groups of products at the same time. However, a data analyst would need to validate that it makes sense for a recommendation engine to group baby clothes with an order of diapers, applesauce and sippy cups.\n",

    "anomaly is the outliers Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying normal patterns within a data sample and then detecting outliers based on the natural characteristics of the data set itself1. In anomaly detection, unsupervised learning is used as you do not pass any labelled values. You train using only the 'non-anomalous' data, select epsilon values, and evaluate with a numerical value (such as F1 score) so that your model will get a good balance of true positives2."
